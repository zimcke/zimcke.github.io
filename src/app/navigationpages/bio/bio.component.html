            My maternal grandparents moved there in 1949 (after the <i>liberation</i>). 
            At that time there was no electricity nor running water for several years. The name stems from a <i>Zil</i>, 
            an old, local unit for measuring farming land. One Zil measures the area of land that one farmer can plow by himself
            with horse and plough. In the case of my grandfather, that must have been quite a lot.
