                    One of my favorite online media channels about Asian culture is Asian boss. Asian boss is an online community that gathers 
                    freelance journalists from multiple Asian countries, such as China, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, etc. In each video, they focus on a
                    specific topic, asking local people to express their opinion on it and thus bringing quite an authentic testimony to the global public.
                    This, I deem very valuable, because the general media seems very biased when they bring news from Asia.
                    I remember seeing a video about how well people know the [fill in] of Chinese characters:

                        At first, you might think that the girl in the video is extremely naive, but is that really the case? If we want to understand 
                        her reasoning better, we need to dive deeper into how the Chinese language works. 
                        The basis of the Chinese written language was already present during the Shang dynasty between 1600 B.C. and 1027 B.C. 
                        We know this from inscriptions on bronze vessels and oracle bones. 
                        A portion of Chinese characters were conceived as depections of existing objects or scenes and at that time they were still relatively
                        recognizable. An example of this is shown on the left. [find example and explain the etymology]. However, this is not 
                        the largest category of Chinese characters. Besides pictograms, there are also [insert] that are combinations of multiple 
                        characters. 
                        These characters often contain another character that might suggest the reader what the proper pronunciation ressembles like.
